the nuclear war building in the world finally happened in the year 2256, with the discovery and invention of an accelerator that could store force in objects, leading to much more force in a bomb than would normally be possible. with the dropping of the first tested new bomb, the entire world was plunged into that freaky green color as people's matter either evaporated entirely or collided and combined with the radiation to form awful amalgamations (if you want enemies or NPCs in your game). Delilah Halcyon was the lead scientist in the designing of the accelerator, and you find scattered notes from them around the playable world. You introduce yourself to others as Sprink, somebody on a mission to activate a government failsafe to a nuclear wasteland (like the one you're in now) and clear as much radiation from the atmosphere as possible so the earth might be able to heal. at the end of the game, just before the credits roll, sprink takes off their helmet to activate the retina scanner on the device and is revealed by a computer to be delilah halcyon
